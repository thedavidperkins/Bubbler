# Bubbler
Simple Android productivity app

This app is designed as a minimal to-do list for persistent priorities: tapping an item will bump it 
to the bottom of the list, while holding it will give the option to move up by one, move down by one,
move to top, move to bottom, or delete. The expectation is that by facilitating the bump to the bottom
of the list, users will use the app to track priorities as they "bubble" up past other priorities.

Bubbler *can* be used for one-time task priorities, but it is more cumbersome and not in line
with the design intent.

As an example, suppose you have three long-term projects: you are writing a novel, learning a dance, and
trying to watch every season of The Wire. You would have an entry for each item on Bubbler in a linear
list. On Monday, the list might look like {novel, dance, The Wire}. Then you sit down after work Monday,
write a couple pages (however much qualifies to you as sufficient attention for now), open Bubbler, and
tap "novel". The list will now read {dance, The Wire, novel}. You know, then, that it's time to dance on
Tuesday after work.

I am not an Android Developer by trade and I have no immediate intent to monetize or distribute this
software. I simply wanted an app to help keep all my plates spinning.

If others wish to contribute to the project, by all means I welcome innovation.
